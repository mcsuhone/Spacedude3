# Feedback for project plan

Class structure seems good, but your UML diagram doesn't differentiate between inheritance and other types of relations, which makes it a bit hard to read.

Networking is a very challenging thing to implement so I hope that you know what you're doing. Your plan doesn't really go into detail about how you're going to implement networking which has me a bit worried.

Work distribution seems fine.

The planned schedule is very vague. You should at least have some rough dates for when certain features should be finished.
